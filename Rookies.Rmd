## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import}
library("tidyverse")
library("GGally")
Rookies <- read.csv("2021 rookies.csv")
```
I need to change ANY/A from a character to a number
```{r change data types}
Rookies$ANY.A <- as.numeric(Rookies[,13])
Rookies$Week <- as.factor(Rookies[,2])
``` 
I want to see the basic stats
```{r basic summary}
head(Rookies)
summary(Rookies)
```
Now to see any correlation 
```{r cor}
cor(Rookies[, c(5,6,seq(11,13,1))])
ggpairs(Rookies, columns = c(5,6,seq(11,13,1)),title = 'Advanced Stat Correlation')
```
## Including Plots
make a scatter plot to compare the stats to see if there is any correlation between numbers. I created the weekly scatterplot to see the week by week progression for each qb. 

```{r plots}
ggplot(data=Rookies, aes(x=QB.Rating, y=EPA, color=Player,shape=Result)) +geom_point()+ ggtitle('EPA vs QBR')
ggplot(data=Rookies, aes(x=EPA, y=ANY.A, color=Player,shape=Result)) +geom_point()+ggtitle('ANY/A vs EPA')
ggplot(data=Rookies, aes(x=ANY.A, y=QB.Rating, color=Player,shape=Result)) +geom_point()+ggtitle('QBR vs ANY/A')
ggplot(data=Rookies, aes(x=Week, y = QB.Rating, color=Player,shape=Result)) +geom_point()+ggtitle('Rookie\'s QBR Weekly')
```
now I am looking at some box plots. I want to see the overall ranges which these qbs perform, the smaller the range, the more consistent their play is. I also look at wins vs losses to see if there is a significant difference in play. I checked week to week just to see how much variance in play between player there are in one week.

```{r box plots}
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Player,y=EPA))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Rookie\'s EPA')
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Player,y=QB.Rating))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Rookie\'s QBR')
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Player,y=ANY.A))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Rookie\'s ANY/A')
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Result,y=ANY.A))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Winner\'s vs Loser\'s ANY/A')
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Result,y=EPA))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Winner\'s vs Loser\'s EPA')
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Result,y=QB.Rating))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Winner\'s vs Loser\'s QBR')
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Week,y=ANY.A))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Weekly ANY/A')
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Week,y=EPA))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Weekly EPA')
ggplot(Rookies,aes(x=Week,y=QB.Rating))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle('Weekly QBR')
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
